main.py - main program
fragment.glsl - fragment shader
vertex.glsl - vertex shader (just a basic template, not much going on here)

In order to use this program you have to add the audio you wish to display as a .wav file into the folder with the other files.
Additionally, you need to insert the file's name in line 24 of main.py

Enjoy!
